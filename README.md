# Plant watering with Raspberry Pi

This is the "watering" script to taking care of our plants controlled by a Raspberry Pi. The python script works on Raspberry Pi 2, Zero W (1/2) and above
with pump, relay and magnetic switch.

### Explanation
"watering.py" is the main control script on the Pi. Put it in a separate directory ("/home/pi/scripts") and start it after the Pi boots up.

"index.php" is our PHP script for our web interface. Put in a specific directory under the document root of your webspace. After that you can remotly control the Pi putting this URL to the adressbar of your browser.
